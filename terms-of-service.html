                <h2>2. Communications</h2>

                <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.</p>
                <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>

Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

                <h2>5. Free Trial</h2>

                <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.</p>
                <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by BloodLine until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
                <p>At any time and without notice, BloodLine reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
